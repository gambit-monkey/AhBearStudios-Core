## Modular High-Performance Core System Architecture for Unity

Welcome to the core system design documentation for the `AhBearStudios.Core` library.

This project provides a modular, composable foundation for high-performance Unity game development without ECS, leveraging:

* **Unity Jobs & Burst**
* **Unity Collections v2**
* **Swappable Interfaces for All Systems**

---

## 🔰 Design Phases

Each phase builds upon the last and is documented independently for team reference.

### 📁 [Phase 0 - Project Setup](01_Phase0_ProjectSetup.md)

Establish the foundational folder, assembly, and CI structure for scalable system development.

### 🔧 [Phase 1 - Core Interfaces](02_Phase1_CoreInterfaces.md)

Define clean, system-agnostic contracts for each core system to maximize modularity and testing.

### 🧩 [Phase 2 - System Implementations](03_Phase2_SystemImplementations.md)

Adapter implementations for third-party systems like VContainer, MessagePipe, FishNet, and MongoDB.

### 🧪 [Phase 3 - Tools & Visualizations](04_Phase3_ToolsAndVisualizations.md)

Editor integration and live tools for diagnostics, metrics, and monitoring across systems.

### 🚀 [Phase 4 - Integration & Bootstrapping](05_Phase4_Integration.md)

Connect all systems into the game lifecycle with DI-based boot logic and headless server support.

## 💡 Principles

* Composition over inheritance
* Clean separation of concerns
* Burst-compatible when possible
* Plug-and-play system replacement
* Unmanaged+Managed type support
* Editor tooling optional in builds

---

## 🚧 Status

Currently in active development — systems are being prototyped in interface-first design mode.
